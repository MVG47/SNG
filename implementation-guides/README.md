## 🛠 Technology Stack Summary

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN/UI
- **3D/Maps**: Mapbox GL JS + Three.js
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **State**: Zustand + React Hook Form
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## 📝 Development Notes

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Mapbox API token
- Basic understanding of React/Next.js
- Familiarity with TypeScript

### Common Patterns
- All components use TypeScript with strict typing
- Animations follow consistent easing curves
- State management is centralized through Zustand
- Mock data is realistic and interconnected
- Performance is prioritized in all implementations

### Best Practices
- Use `'use client'` for interactive components
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Follow ShadCN patterns for UI consistency
- Optimize images and lazy-load heavy components
- Test on mobile devices throughout development

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Mapbox not loading**: Check API token and network access
2. **Animation performance**: Reduce concurrent animations or use CSS transforms
3. **Bundle size**: Use dynamic imports for heavy components
4. **TypeScript errors**: Ensure all types are properly imported
5. **Mobile responsiveness**: Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools

### Debug Tips
- Use React Developer Tools for state inspection
- Enable Mapbox debug mode for globe issues
- Use Framer Motion DevTools for animation debugging
- Monitor Network tab for loading performance
- Check console for runtime errors
